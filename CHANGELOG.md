## 4.1.0 - Released 28 May 2024

**IMPORTANT**: With Parley 4.1.0 there is a minor breaking change with appearance. Migrating can be done easily by adjusting to the new `ParleyTextViewAppearance` in such cases.

- Styling: `ParleyTextViewAppearance` has been introduced to be able to style the fonts and colors for text views used by Parley.
- Styling: `MessageCollectionViewCellAppearance` now has `messageTextViewAppearance` (instead of just the `messageColor` attribute).
- Styling: `ParleyMessageViewAppearance` now has `messageTextViewAppearance` (instead of just the `messageColor` and `messageTintColor` attribute).
- Styling: `ParleyStickyViewAppearance` now has `textViewAppearance` (instead of just the `color` and `tintColor` attribute).
- Preventing duplicate creation of some classes.
- Added `Parley.setAlwaysPolling(enabled)` to be able to always enable polling. Default `false`, since the Parley refreshes the chat when needed via push notifications.
  Note: By default polling is only enabled when notification permissions are denied (unchanged compared to previous versions).
- Added `ParleyMessageViewAppearance.imageCorners` to specify the rounding corners for images.
- The `set` methods that have a callback always call their callback now (instead of only when Parley was configured).
- Better type safety in cell usage.
- Prevent initialization of some classes and observers while Parley wasn't using them yet (now they are created when used).
- Added screenshot testing.
- Fixed an issue with scaling of texts when using bigger/smaller font settings.
- Updated SSL pinning certificates.
- Fixed an issue with the image viewer not scaling images correctly.

## 4.0.2 - Released 8 Apr 2024

- Added `ParleyViewAppearance.loaderTintColor` to tint the loading indicator of the chat.

## 4.0.1 - Released 5 Apr 2024

### Upgrading:

**IMPORTANT**: With Parley 4.0.1 the `ParleyNetworkSession` has the `parameters` method changed to `data`. 

- This is only a small breaking change syntax-wise when implementing your own `ParleyNetworkSession`.
- The content of `data` should be put as the body of the request (the request content type is `application/json`, so if needed, it may be encoded as JSON in the body).
- Check out Parley's standard `AlamofireNetworkSession` to see how this is could be implemented.

### Changes:

- Updated `ParleyNetworkSession` protocol: Changed `parameters` to `data` to correctly reflect the intended usage.

## 4.0.0 - Released 15 Mar 2024

### Upgrading:

**IMPORTANT**: With Parley 4.0.0 there are a few breaking changes. Migrating can be done easily with a few changes.

_What's changed?_

- In Parley 3.9.2 and lower Parley provided a network implementation which uses the Alamofire dependency. Therefore the dependency to Alamofire was attached to the project by Parley.
- In Parley 4.0.0 and higher the network implementation is separated from the core. Resulting in the modules: `Parley` (required) and `ParleyNetwork` (optional). This enables using your own network implementation and prevents requiring the use of dependencies that the standard Parley implementation uses. When providing your own network implementation, there is no need to import `ParleyNetwork` to your project. For more information, see [Advanced - Network layer](README.md#network-layer).
- In Parley 4.0.0 some deprecated methods have been removed which used default values for their parameters for backwards compatibility. These were deprecated for a while already, and similar methods are available under the same name. Provide the required parameters now when facing this.
- In Parley 4.0.0 the Parley datasource required to enabling offline messaging has been split up to different datasources. Each datasource has its own responsibility now, rather than one datasource doing everything. All datasources are required to enable offline messaging. Parley still provides standard implementations for enabling offline messaging. See [Advanced - Offline messaging](README.md#offline-messaging) for the new implementation.
- In Parley 4.0.0 the `ParleyNetwork` to configure the network configuration (base url, path, api version and headers) has been renamed to `ParleyNetworkConfig`. The underlying structure remained the same.
- In Parley 4.0.0 the `Parley.setNetwork` method has been removed. Pass the new `ParleyNetworkConfig` to the `Parley.configure()` method.
- In Parley 4.0.0 support for the Parley Client API version 1.0 to 1.5 has been dropped. Please update to a newer version when using 1.5 or lower, for the available versions, see [Version lifetime](https://developers.parley.nu/docs/version-lifetime).

### Changes:

- Split up Parley package to `Parley` and `ParleyNetwork`. You can now use Parley with your own http network layer. To do so you can implement `ParleyNetworkSession`.
- Update Reachability to 5.2.0 (from 5.1.0)
- Move configuring network settings to the `Parley.configure` function to make the setup order more clear.
- Rename `ParleyNetwork` to `ParleyNetworkConfig` to better represent what the struct does.
- Removed support for Client API 1.0 to 1.5.
- Added appearance option to hide the offline and push disabled notification views ([#73](https://github.com/parley-messaging/ios-library/issues/73)).

## 3.9.2 - Released 16 Feb 2024

- Fixed taking pictures not sending (regression by 3.9.1).
- Fixed an issue where small image messages were not taking the full width.
- Fixed an issue causing some texts to display wrong.
- Fixed an issue causing loading more triggering too early and inconsistently.
- Fixed an issue where the chat wouldn't scroll fully to the bottom directly when opening the chat.
- Added support for client API 1.7.
- Removed an unneeded guard statement when handling push messages.

## 3.9.1 - Released 13 Feb 2024

- Parley now returns the formatted error message of the backend when an error occurs when configuring or registering the device.
- When selecting or sending an image that will fail to upload, an alert will be shown with the relevant error.
- When an image inside the chat contains an error, the error message will be shown in the chat.
- Resolved some memory leaks.
- Fixed an issue that could cause quick replies to show invisible, but taking up space.

## 3.9.0 - Released 17 Jan 2024

- Parley now uses `Codable` for mapping the models (instead of ObjectMapper). This change is backwards compatible. Existing chats remain unaffected and will continue to work.
- Updated Alamofire to 5.8.1 (from 5.4.1).
- Updated AlamofireImage to 4.3.0 (from 4.1.0).
- Removed ObjectMapper dependency.
- Fixed tests not showing up in Xcode.
- Moved library and the example project to SPM structure and removed CocoaPods structure.

- Added Dynamic Type support.
- Added support for VoiceOver.
  - Read through the chat.

## 3.5.1 - Released 21 Jul 2022

- Fixed crashes when using carousels and quick replies when using SPM.

## 3.5.0 - Released 2 May 2022

### Upgrading:

Parley now uses a unique device id per app installation as default setting.

**IMPORTANT**: When using anonymous chats, the chat now always starts empty after a new app installation by default.

_What's changed?_

- In Parley 3.4.2 and lower the iOS `identifierForVendor` was used as device id. This device id does not change per app installation, causing anonymous chats to continue with their existing chat even when the user deleted and reinstalled the app. 
- In Parley 3.5.0 and higher a random UUID is used as device id. This value is stored in the user defaults by default and is generated once per installation. Updating the app won't result in a new device id as long as the user defaults aren't cleared. This ensures that new anonymous chats always start empty.

**Note**: This only affects the behavior of starting anonymous chats, chats that use the user authorization won't be affected by this change.

**Note**: This is the default behavior of Parley. When passing the device id to the configure method, Parley will use that as device id instead and won't store it in the user defaults either.

### Changes:

- Device id is now unique per installation, instead of using the iOS `identifierForVendor`. Affects how anonymous chats are handled.
- Added optional `Parley.reset(callback)` method to reset Parley back to its initial state, clearing the user and chat data that is in memory.

## 3.4.2 - Released 2 May 2022

- Added optional `uniqueDeviceIdentifier` parameter to the configure method to override the default device identifier that Parley uses.

## 3.4.1 - Released 19 Jan 2022

- Fixed date message not showing up directly when sending the first message of the day
- Fixed date messages showing incorrect date in some cases

## 3.4.0 - Released 12 Nov 2021

- Added `ParleyViewAppearance.notificationsPosition` to configure where the notifications should be shown in the chat: `.top` (default) or `.bottom`.
  For example: to show them on the bottom of the chat, use:
  ```
  let appearance = ParleyViewAppearance(...) 
  appearance.notificationsPosition = .bottom
  parleyView.appearance = appearance
  ```

## 3.3.1 - Released 10 Nov 2021

- Fixed an issue where (sticky) messages were hidden unintentionally due to concurrency
- Fixed links within parentheses not being clickable

## 3.3.0 - Released 27 Oct 2021

### Updating:

- **NOTE (BREAKING)**: When specyfing a custom `ParleyNetwork` and using API 1.5 or lower, the default implementation may break the images functionality in the chat. To resolve this: specify the used `apiVersion` in the `ParleyNetwork`.
- **DEPRECATION**: Using `ParleyNetwork` without `apiVersion` is now deprecated. Please specify an `apiVersion` when using `ParleyNetwork`.
- **DEPRECATION**: `ParleyMessageViewAppearance.buttonHeight` is now deprecated and unused since version 3.3.0. Style the buttons by using `ParleyMessageViewAppearance.buttonInsets` instead.

### Changes:

- Added support for API 1.6
- Added `ApiVersion` parameter to `ParleyNetwork`
- By default Parley will now target API 1.6
- Parley is now using the new media implementation when using API 1.6 or higher
