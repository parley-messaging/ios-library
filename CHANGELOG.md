# Changelog

## 3.5.0 - Upcoming

### Upgrading:

Parley now uses a unique device id per app installation as default setting.

**IMPORTANT**: When using anonymous chats, the chat now always starts empty after a new app installation by default.

_What's changed?_

- In Parley 3.4.2 and lower the iOS `identifierForVendor` was used as device id. This device id does not change per app installation, causing anonymous chats to continue with their existing chat even when the user deleted and reinstalled the app. 
- In Parley 3.5.0 and higher a random UUID is used as device id. This value is stored in the user defaults by default and is generated once per installation. Updating the app won't result in a new device id as long as the user defaults aren't cleared. This ensures that new anonymous chats always start empty.

**Note**: This only affects the behavior of starting anonymous chats, chats that use the user authorization won't be affected by this change.

**Note**: This is the default behavior of Parley. When passing the device id to the configure method, Parley will use that as device id instead and won't store it in the user defaults either.

### Changes:

- Device id is now unique per installation, instead of using the iOS `identifierForVendor`. Affects how anonymous chats are handled.
- Added optional `Parley.reset(callback)` method to reset Parley back to its initial state, clearing the user and chat data that is in memory.

## 3.4.2 - Released 2 May 2022

- Added optional `uniqueDeviceIdentifier` parameter to the configure method to override the default device identifier that Parley uses.

## 3.4.1 - Released 19 Jan 2022

- Fixed date message not showing up directly when sending the first message of the day
- Fixed date messages showing incorrect date in some cases

## 3.4.0 - Released 12 Nov 2021

- Added `ParleyViewAppearance.notificationsPosition` to configure where the notifications should be shown in the chat: `.top` (default) or `.bottom`.
  For example: to show them on the bottom of the chat, use:
  ```
  let appearance = ParleyViewAppearance(...) 
  appearance.notificationsPosition = .bottom
  parleyView.appearance = appearance
  ```

## 3.3.0 - Released 27 Oct 2021

### Updating:

- **NOTE (BREAKING)**: When specyfing a custom `ParleyNetwork` and using API 1.5 or lower, the default implementation may break the images functionality in the chat. To resolve this: specify the used `apiVersion` in the `ParleyNetwork`.
- **DEPRECATION**: Using `ParleyNetwork` without `apiVersion` is now deprecated. Please specify an `apiVersion` when using `ParleyNetwork`.
- **DEPRECATION**: `ParleyMessageViewAppearance.buttonHeight` is now deprecated and unused since version 3.3.0. Style the buttons by using `ParleyMessageViewAppearance.buttonInsets` instead.

### Changes:

- Added support for API 1.6
- Added `ApiVersion` parameter to `ParleyNetwork`
- By default Parley will now target API 1.6
- Parley is now using the new media implementation when using API 1.6 or higher
